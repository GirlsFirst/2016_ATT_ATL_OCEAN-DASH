<h3>Hi, I'm Zainab!</h3>

I'll be a rising senior at Lakeside High School. I love all things computer science, medicine, and journalism! I'm 
hoping to have a career that can include all three! Girls Who Code has been such a wonderful 
experience because I've found that in CS you are literally the creator of all of your projects so it's nice to
be able to put your thoughts into code (even if it can take quite some time)!

Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase. <br> </br>

<h3> Hi, I'm Brianna!

homeschooler, and now lover of CS!
I spend most of my spare time cooking and spending time with my three siblings. 
I really value family and friends and love making people happy with food! I've really enjoyed

 <h3> My name is Davielle Matos and I am 17, a Christian, a gamer and a lover for technology. I spend most of my time reading, playing cello, and intellectually challenging myself (solving Rubik's cubes). I plan on going to Georgia Tech and then to MIT for grad school for a double major of computer science and video game design. I love technology and enjoy studying more about it in the future.</h3>
